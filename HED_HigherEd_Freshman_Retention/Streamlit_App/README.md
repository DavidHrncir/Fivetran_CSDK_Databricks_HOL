![StudentSuccess](images/StudentSuccess.png)

A Fivetran and Databricks-powered Streamlit data application for Higher Education with advanced AI Agent Workflows.

## Overview

StudentSuccess is an AI-driven freshman retention insights system that helps higher education institutions automate the manual and time-consuming process of analyzing student academic performance and engagement data. This Streamlit on Databricks data application helps academic advisors, student success coordinators, and enrollment management teams improve retention rates, reduce dropout costs, minimize intervention time, and increase student success through real-time analysis of academic and engagement data.

The application features sophisticated AI Agent Workflows that provide transparent, step-by-step analysis of student success data, transforming complex academic records into actionable retention insights and predictive intervention strategies. Each analysis focus area operates through specialized mini-agents that simulate the decision-making process of experienced academic advisors and student success professionals.

The application utilizes a synthetic higher education dataset that simulates data from student information systems (SIS), learning management systems (LMS), and academic integrity systems. This synthetic data is moved into Databricks using a custom connector built with the Fivetran Connector SDK, enabling reliable and efficient data pipelines for higher education analytics.
