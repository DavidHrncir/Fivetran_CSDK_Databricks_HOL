A Fivetran and Databricks-powered Streamlit data application for Oil & Gas with advanced AI Agent Workflows.

## Overview

LogLynx is an AI-driven field technician task summarization system that helps oil and gas operations automate the manual and time-consuming process of analyzing daily logs from field technicians. This Streamlit on Databricks data application helps field technicians, maintenance managers, and operations managers reduce failed treatments, decrease maintenance costs, minimize equipment downtime, and save manual summarization time through real-time analysis of field operations data.

The application features sophisticated AI Agent Workflows that provide transparent, step-by-step analysis of field operations data, transforming complex maintenance logs into actionable operational insights and predictive maintenance strategies. Each analysis focus area operates through specialized mini-agents that simulate the decision-making process of experienced field operations managers and maintenance engineers.

The application utilizes a synthetic oil and gas dataset that simulates data from field technician logs, computerized maintenance management systems (CMMS), and enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems. This synthetic data is moved into Databricks using a custom connector built with the Fivetran Connector SDK, enabling reliable and efficient data pipelines for oil and gas operations analytics.
